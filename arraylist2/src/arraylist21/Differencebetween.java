	// Difference between array and arraylist
	
	// In Java, an array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type
	// Core difference is arraylist is dynamic hence size can be increase or decrease
	// - but in array once size is fixed can not be cchange.
	
	
	// ex  arr[][]= new arra[]3[3] is fixed array of 3*3 row and coloumn
	// Arraylist<Object> obj = new Arraylist<object>; is dynamci
